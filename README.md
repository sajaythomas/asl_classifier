# Hand Gesture Classification

This project is a hand gesture classifier using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) where it can classify sign languages on individual letters or numbers. The data collected is from Massey University which comprises of 2515 images of 0-9 and A-Z from 5 different subjects. The model was trained on the EfficientNet B5 architecture. EfficientNet is a family of neural network architectures that were designed to be more efficient in terms of computational resources while still achieving strong accuracy on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, object detection, and machine translation. For this project, the model acheived 97% accuracy.
